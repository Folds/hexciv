The goals of this project are to:
* develop a playable game similar to Civilization
* with hexagonal cells
* on a spherical world (technically icosahedral),
* whose artificial intelligences (AIs) do not cheat
* in Java.

Major [issues](https://github.com/Folds/hexciv/wiki/Issues) have yet to be decided, including:
* The open-source license.
